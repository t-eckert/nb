# *NotaBene* (nb) is a command line application for taking notes and daily logs

`nb` is a command line application for taking notes with markdown.

This is what I use to manage my notebook in Markdown using Neovim. I maintain
it just for myself, but I welcome anyone to fork it and make it their own.

## Installation

```bash
go install github.com/t-eckert/nb@latest
```
